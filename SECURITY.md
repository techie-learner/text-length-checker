## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability
Hi! I’m 12 years old and still learning Python.  
If you find a security issue or bug:

1. Please **be kind and respectful** when reporting.  
2. Open an issue in this repository with clear steps to show the problem.  
3. I may not reply very fast (since I’m still learning and not always active), but I will try my best.  
4. If the issue is valid, I’ll work on fixing it in the next update.

## 🤝 Community Guidelines
- Remember this is a beginner project.  
- Please avoid rude or abusive language — I’m learning and want to improve.  
- Helpful, friendly feedback is always welcome.

## ✅ Commitment
Even though I’m young and new to coding, I take safety seriously.  
I will do my best to fix problems and keep the project safe for everyone.
