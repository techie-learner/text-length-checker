# text-length-checker
This is a simplest length checker made by me. It's my first python projects in GitHub. 


Used only using print, length, variables, input and while True function.


I convert it to .exe using auto-py-to-exe.


It's very ease to use, just click it and the interface would open and paste your desired text and press enter and tada! It telled how many characters it has.
